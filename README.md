# Age vs. Sleep Duration â€“ Statistical Analysis

This repository contains two statistical analyses exploring the relationship between **age** and **sleep duration**.  
The analyses are based on the [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) from kaggle.

This project was completed as part of the course *Principles & Applications in Stat Analysis*, focusing on both descriptive and inferential methods.
